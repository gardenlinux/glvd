# Local Podman version of GLVD

The scripts in this directory replicate the functionality of the [compose](../compose/README.md) setup without the need for Docker Compose.

Bringing up a local instance of GLVD should be as easy as running `start-glvd.sh`, and stopping as easy as running `stop-glvd.sh`.
