# GLVD compose setup

This compose setup requires [Docker Compose >= v2](https://github.com/docker/compose), but does not require docker engine/cli.

The recommended setup is to install podman in combination with Docker Compose >= v2

For setups based on a pure podman install, see [podman](../podman/README.md) instead.
