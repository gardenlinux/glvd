# GLVD User Stories

# USER-01

As a user of Garden Linux I want to know about security issues in Garden Linux so I can operate my systems responsibly.

## Acceptance Criteria 

- [ ] The user can query for known CVEs of a list packages

## Additional details

- This does not yet require a nice user interface, an HTTP API is sufficient
- This does not yet include knowledge about which packages are included in any given Garden Linux image, the user provides a list of package names and versions

# USER-02 (lower prio)

As a user of Garden Linux I want to subscribe to updates on new security issues in the packages I care about.

## Acceptance Criteria 

- [ ] The user can get notifications for new known CVEs affecting their list of packages
- [ ] The user can unsubscribe from notifications

## Additional details

- This might be implemented in an anonymous way where the user gets a tracking url/rss feed they need to bookmark
- The backend/db needs to keep track of tracking urls
- Users might want to subscribe with their email address; this introduces a new class of issues legally (data protection)

# USER-05

As a user of Garden Linux I want to be notified of new CVEs in the Garden Linux patch version I'm using.

## Acceptance Criteria 

- [ ] I can select the Garden Linux version (like 1443.5) I'm using to be notified on new CVEs for that specific version
- [ ] I get a notification for new patch releases in that version (like 1443.6) so I can upgrade as soon as possible
- [ ] I can select a Garden Linux major version (like 1443) to be notified on new and fixed CVEs in that version

# De-prioritized user stories

# USER-03

As a user of Garden Linux I want to track security issues in any given Garden Linux *image* so I can make an informed decision about needed actions in my system.

## Acceptance Criteria

# GLDEV-01

As a developer of Garden Linux I want to assess the security impact of adding packages to Garden Linux images.

## Acceptance Criteria 

- [ ] I can query individual packages within the Garden Linux APT repo for known CVEs, for package versions included in the available releases
- [ ] I can use released Garden Linux images as a pre-set and add packages to see what additional CVEs are added with the additional packages

# GLDEV-02

As a developer of Garden Linux I want to add context information on CVE that might be fixed or not applicable to Garden Linux.

## Acceptance Criteria

# Notes from discussion

- Get List of vuln by package name and version
- Get List of vuln packages by distro
- Get List of vuln packages by image
  - needs manifest files from images (package list with version), generated by builder
- Get List of vuln packages by ocm descriptor (maybe)
- Get List of vuln packages by CVE id
- Triage for GL vuln
  - output ocm (potential issues, immutability, pull/poll, api, ?)
  - outbut bdba (maybe)
